# Cat-vs.-Dog-Image-Classification-using-Backpropagation-Neural-Network
Project Description:  In this Python project, you will build a neural network from scratch to perform binary image classification, distinguishing between cats and dogs. You will implement the backpropagation algorithm to train the neural network on a dataset of labeled cat and dog images.
